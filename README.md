# Russia-ukrain_war_Analysis

Russia-Ukraine war coverage and details is being covered by many people and coverage by Prof. Kotkin is one of popular youtube places. Comments by people on youtube was collected and a wordcloud is generated to identify frequency of words used by public.
I previously named it "public sentiment" but it was misleading as it doesnt show what people's sentiment is by analysing mere words and comments written by them.
