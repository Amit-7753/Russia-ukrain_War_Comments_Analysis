# Russia-Ukrain_War_Comments_Analysis

Russia-Ukraine war coverage and details is being covered by many people and coverage by Prof. Kotkin is one of popular youtube places. Comments by people on youtube was collected and a wordcloud is generated to identify frequency of words used by public. And uninteresting words like - is, and , where, how, kotkin etc has been ignored.

I previously named it **public sentiment** but it was misleading as it doesnt show what people's sentiment is by analysing mere words and comments written by them.
